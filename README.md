# Belly – Fridge Management App for iOS
**Belly** is a lightweight iOS app for managing fridge inventory. It helps users track expiration dates, organize items by shelf or category, and generate recipe ideas based on what's available. Designed for offline use and minimal interaction, the app allows users to quickly scan their fridge, monitor expiring items, and reduce food waste without manual logging.

This project was developed independently, from initial concept to deployment. I handled product design, UI/UX, development in Xcode (SwiftUI), and user testing to refine usability and layout.

## Features
- **Smart Item Detection** - Camera-based food recognition using AI
- **Expiration Tracking** - Visual countdown labels and alerts
- **Smart Organization** - Categorize items by type and location (freezer, top shelf, etc.)
- **Recipe Suggestions** - AI-powered meal ideas based on available ingredients
- **Offline-First** - All core features work without internet connection
- **Intuitive UI** - Clean, cute design optimized for quick interactions

## App Structure
The app is organized into three main modules:
### 1. **Fridge** (Home Tab)
- **Expiring Soon** – Displays items nearing expiration with visual countdown
- **Inventory** – Lists all items organized by category and location
- **Recipe Suggestions** – AI-generated meal ideas based on current inventory

### 2. **Add Items** (Camera Tab)
- **Camera Scan** – Point and shoot to automatically detect and categorize food items
- **Manual Entry** – Quick manual addition for items that need custom input
- **Smart Recognition** – AI-powered food identification and expiration estimation

### 3. **Shopping** (Cart Tab)
- **Shopping Lists** – Generate lists based on low inventory or meal planning
- **Smart Suggestions** – Recommendations for items to restock

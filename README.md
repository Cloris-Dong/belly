# Belly (Fridge Management App for iOS)

**Belly** is a lightweight iOS app for managing fridge inventory. It helps users track expiration dates, organize items by shelf or category, and generate recipe ideas based on what's available. Designed for offline use and minimal interaction, the app allows users to quickly scan their fridge, monitor expiring items, and reduce food waste without manual logging.

This project was developed independently, from initial concept to deployment. I handled product design, UI/UX, development in Xcode (SwiftUI), backend integration, and user testing to refine usability and layout.


## Features
- **Smart Item Detection** – Camera-based food recognition using AI  
- **Expiration Tracking** – Visual countdown labels and alerts  
- **Smart Organization** – Categorize items by type and location (freezer, top shelf, etc.)  
- **Recipe Suggestions** – AI-powered meal ideas based on current inventory  
- **Shopping Lists** – Generate lists from low inventory or meal planning  


## Design & Architecture
- **Offline-First** – Core functionality works without internet connection  
- **Vercel Backend** – Lightweight backend for API hosting and deployment  
- **Intuitive UI** – Clean, minimal design optimized for quick interactions
